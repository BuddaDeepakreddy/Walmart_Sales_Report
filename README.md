I recently completed a comprehensive sales analysis project, where I sourced a rich dataset from Kaggle and leveraged the power of Power BI to create an insightful and visually appealing dashboard. The dashboard provides a deep dive into sales performance, featuring key metrics such as total profits, sales, customer count, and order quantities. It also includes detailed visualizations like:
Monthly sales trends over time
Top 10 high-profit products
Average profits and sales
A geographical sales distribution map
Filters for city-wise and date-wise analysis
The process involved thorough data cleaning, transformation, and analysis to uncover actionable insights, all of which were seamlessly integrated into an interactive dashboard using Power BI. This project not only honed my skills in data visualization and business intelligence but also deepened my understanding of how data-driven insights can empower decision-making.
Iâ€™m proud of the outcome and the value it can bring to understanding sales dynamics! Check out the screenshot of the dashboard below. ðŸ“ˆ

Iâ€™d love to hear your feedback or connect to discuss data analytics, visualization, or potential opportunities! ðŸš€
